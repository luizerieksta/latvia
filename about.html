			<h2>Description</h2>
			<p>Latvia Over the Past 100 years is a website dedicated for the 100-year anniversary of Latvia in 2018. It tells a story revolving around some of the most important demographic information and uses data to visualize population trends. It is addressed to both Latvians and foreigners who know nothing about Latvia, in order to introduce them to the country's history through demographic data. When the user lands on the main page of the website, he or she reads the title of the project and a very short description and then clicks the 'Click to continue button' which brings the user to the next page. All the following pages are either presenting some factual information or containing the graphs which visualize the demographic data. The information which explains what can be seen in the data is presented both before and after seeing the graphs. Before seeing a particular graph the user is informed about what he or she is going to see next and on the next page after the graph some more context is given to explain key historical moments reflected by the graphs. On the pages of the graphs the user interacts with the graph by hovering over the bars and seeing additional information appear, thus receiving feedback from their interaction. The user clicks on arrow buttons to navigate through the pages and can always go both forward or backward, thus never getting stuck on a page and not having to use the browser’s back button. The arrow buttons are transparent cues to click on them and go either forward or backward because users are so familiar with this type of interaction. When the user reaches the end, he or she has the ability to go back either to the previous page or return to the very beginning and start over. 
			<h2>Motivation and Creation Process</h2>
			<p>My motivation for creating this project was taking data about Latvia that doesn't speak much about itself when existing in a dataset alone, and using the power of creating interactive charts to give more meaning to this data and look at it from a different perspective. I was really keen on the idea of trying to visualize as many years as possible to get as close as I could to representing 100 years of history in just a few charts. I think it is impressive how much more meaning can be given to data when it is represented this way instead of an Excel spreadsheet, for example. The data starts "speaking for itself", one can start to see emerging patterns and get an overall view on the country's history through its demographic data. In order to make it more of a learning experience I also added the written explanations and information about historical events that have impacted the population trends. I wanted the user to be able to both explore and interact with the charts at his or her own will and look and particular things that seem interesting to the user, but also give information about some of the most important events that impacted the most dramatic shifts in population trends. The 100-year anniversary is also a significant event in Latvia, thus I was particularly passionate about working with this data. Many creations like art installations, documentaries and books are presented to the public as a contribution to the country and the celebration of its history. I think that my project is my contribution to my country on its centennial, as I tried to appreciate its history and do something meaningful with the data that has been collected over the years.</p>
			<p>The process of creating this project started with the collection of data. I found the data on the database of the Central Statistical Bureau of Latvia, which has done a good job at keeping the data organized and understandable to navigate through. The link to the database is available here:<br>
				<a href="https://www.csb.gov.lv/en/statistika/db"><div class="about-page-links">CSB Database</div></a></p>
			<p>I then searched for data that was available for the longest period of time (close to the 100 years) and I soon realized that the most appropriate data for that is the population data, as it has been collected for the longest. As my main dataset I chose the population dataset, which had data from almost all the 100 years, and I then used two other datasets which best supported and explained the shifts in the population size - emigration and fertility. Unfortunately, the data in the emigration dataset was collected by decades during most of the 20th century but the rest was collected every year starting from 1991. Thus, I was not able to create a 100-year chart for this dataset, however, I tried to adapt and worked with the data that was available.</p>
			<p>I saved these datasets as CSV files and converted them to json files and then to js files. Each js file was an array with a list of objects which were the values of the respective dataset and the years. Then I accessed this data in the main js file in which I was writing all the code.</p>
			<p>I started with trying to make a bar chart using d3 and appending the values from my dataset to the bars. After doing that all the charts were of the same height because the data values were relatively large in absolute values, thus I had to scale the values of my data. I looked for the minimum and maximum values in my datasets and used the domain and range attributes to map the values to the bars. When that was done, some clear patterns were already visible.</p>
			<p>I wanted to use the mouseover attribute and change the color of the bar when the user hovers over the respective bar. Besides changing the color of the bar on mouseover, the respective year and number appear below the chart and updates each time that the mouse is moved and hovers over a different bar. I think this is a very fun interaction for the user as they get to choose their own bars of interest and they can explore them by controlling the interaction themselves.</p>
			<p>I also wanted to add the years to the bottom of the bars and have them displayed vertically, which turned out to be less intuitive than I initially expected. Lastly, I added the information pages between the charts and created all the buttons, so the user would be able to navigate freely through my website. At first I only had the arrow button for going forward but after doing user testing in class and receiving feedback from the users, I also added the backwards arrow button, thus improving the user's control over the interaction.</p>
			<h2>Design</h2>
			<p>In terms of design the home page and the information pages have a gradient background in the colors of the Latvian flag. For the charts, I decided to have them in a neutral color grey and when hovering over the bars, they change color to the dark red Latvian flag color. I think that the color that I used in the background of the chart complimented the grey color of the bars well and also it is a color that appeared in the gradient from the two Latvian flag colors, thus sticking to one color palette. I think that the font that I used for the title fits well with the overall theme as well as the font throughout the rest of the website. For the arrows, I chose a very simple style and again a neutral color - dark grey, thus nothing would be standing out from the overall theme.</p>
			<h2>Challenges</h2>
			<p>One of the biggest challenges in terms of code was scaling the values of my data and figuring out which values should be returned as the x and y positions for the rectangles after scaling. Also, appending the years to the bars was something I was having trouble with, as I was accidentally appending the years over and over each other, instead of just doing it once. I also struggled with rotating the years to have them show up vertically because instead of rotating each year individually they were showing up as a long string and only the long string was rotating. After meeting with Craig and looking at other code examples, this challenge was overcome.</p>
			<p>In terms of storytelling my biggest challenge was emphasizing that this is the demographic data I decided to look at because it has had the biggest impact on Latvia's population trends. As we discussed in class, data can be subjective depending on the context in which it is presented. I couldn’t visualize all data about Latvia, thus as the creator of this project I had to make a decision and select which data I will work with. I decided to work with the data that best represents the significant switches in population trends and explained these switches through historical events that have had an effect on the population. One of the articles I recently read which concerns one of the topics I looked at is this:<br>

			<h2>Possible next steps</h2>
			<p>Possible next steps for my project are gathering an even larger amount of data and making the charts more complex in order to look at several trends at once. I would like to keep working on this because I think that more data could help discover even more trends and build a fuller picture.</p>
